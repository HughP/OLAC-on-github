      <synopsis>The SIL International Language and Culture Archives holds
         works authored or edited by members of SIL International or produced by
         a publishing unit of SIL. It houses over 13,000 books, journal articles, book
         chapters, dissertations, and other academic papers about languages and
         cultures. It also has about 8,000 items written in the languages studied,
         such as literacy primers, books on basic education topics (health, math,
         social studies), story books, and translated works. The vast majority of
         works are published. The materials date from 1935 to the present.
      </synopsis>
      <access>Links are given to publications that are directly accessible
         via the Internet. Recent SIL publications may be purchased from the
         International Academic Bookstore (Academic_Books AT sil.org), either
         in paper or in electronic form. Out-of-print SIL publications may be
         obtained by special order. All materials may be viewed by visiting the
         Archives by appointment during normal business hours.
      </access>
      <archivalSubmissionPolicy>The SIL International Language and
         Culture Archives accepts submissions from active and retired SIL staff
         in the areas of language and culture documentation and description,
         and language-based development. Under some circumstances, the
         Archives will also accept materials from former staff and persons
         more casually associated with SIL language work, if such materials
         relate to research done with the assistance of SIL or its staff, and there
         is not a more appropriate institution able to accept and curate the
         materials long-term. Please address any questions to the Archives
         by sending email to archive_dallas AT sil.org.
